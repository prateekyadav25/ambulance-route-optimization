# ambulance-route-optimization
Introduction:
In emergency medical services, timely response plays a crucial role in saving lives. This project Rescue Path , is designed to optimize ambulance routing using graph-based pathfinding algorithms while also considering traffic conditions. The system calculates the shortest and fastest route from a hospital to an accident location, ensuring the ambulance reaches the scene as quickly as possible.
Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a graph-based ambulance routing system that calculates the minimum distance from a hospital to an accident location while also considering traffic on road segments (edges).
•	Vertices : hospitals 
•	Edges : Represent road network with traffic data
•	Weights: Assigned based on factors like road conditions , road length.
Objectives:
•	Develop an efficient system to calculate the shortest and fastest route from a hospital to an accident location using graph-based algorithms like prims or kruskal 
  algorithm.
•	Implement a method to consider traffic congestion on roads (edges) to avoid delays and ensure dynamic path adjustments.
•	Minimize the time taken for an ambulance to reach the accident location, improving emergency medical services and patient survival rates.
•	Apply Dijkstra’s Algorithm or other shortest path techniques* to compute the most optimal route.
