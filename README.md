In emergency medical services, timely response plays a crucial role in saving lives. This project Rescue Path , is designed to optimize ambulance routing using graph-based pathfinding algorithms while also considering traffic conditions. The system calculates the shortest and fastest route from a hospital to an accident location, ensuring the ambulance reaches the scene as quickly as possible.
